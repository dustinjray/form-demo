# About
This is a project from the FreeCodeCamp cirriculum. The task was to create a survey page that met a series of tests, mainly dealing with the presence of certain elements and associated IDs. I also took the opportunity to attempt to work in responsive, mobile-first design without the use of Bootstrap. 

This project is currently a work in progress. Adding to github now to get more practice with git and also to be able to test my design on my actual mobile device instead of just the emulator in Chrome.
