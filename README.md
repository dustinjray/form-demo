# About
This is a project from the FreeCodeCamp cirriculum. The task was to create a survey page that met a series of tests, mainly dealing with the presence of certain elements and associated IDs. I also took the opportunity to attempt to work in responsive, mobile-first design without the use of Bootstrap.
